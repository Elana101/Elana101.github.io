                <p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:20px;color:black;background-color:cadetblue;">Apart from singing and dancing, park Caiying is also good at playing guitar. She has both beauty and strength. She has a slender figure and a strong domineering aura. She shows her superb dancing skills on the stage. She not only has a great music style, but also has a beautiful and lovely image. In the MV, she is dyed rose blonde, very white, but also set her off like a name, with thorns all over her body, but people want to get close to her. She seems to have a noble and famous demeanor emanating from her bones. The golden brown long roll, coupled with the little skirt of the celebrity style, is Princess Rose herself.

                <p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:20px;color:black;background-color:PowderBlue;">Park Caiying in the pictorial always creates a mysterious and gorgeous atmosphere. Every time she shoots, she shows her charm with colorful posture and expression. When she chose the super short skirt with grey pleats and blue shirt, she appeared elegant; in another shooting, she freely showed her mysterious and gorgeous face through pictorial, which was as colorful as her eight color bird charm. Her charming eyes are combined with her hair color to add mysterious charm and make her think of the stars in the night sky, while the diamond inlaid watch adds unique highlights to her black style; she wears a clean white T-shirt and a cool Navy super shirt jacket to create a comfortable style.
